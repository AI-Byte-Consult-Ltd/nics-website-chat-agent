### How to Use

To integrate this chat agent into your website, simply add the following HTML snippet before the closing `</body>` tag on each page where you want the widget to appear.

**Important:** You can customize the `branding` and `style` settings within the `window.ChatWidgetConfig` object. **Do not modify the `script src` URL** for the chat widget script itself, as this points to the hosted version in this repository.

```html
<script>
    window.ChatWidgetConfig = {
        webhook: {
            // This is your unique webhook URL for chat communication.
            // Replace with your actual webhook endpoint.
            url: 'https://your.website/webhook/f406671e-c954-4691-b39a-66c90aa2f103/chat', 
            route: 'general'
        },
        branding: {
            logo: '<your company logo URL>', // Optional: URL to your company logo (e.g., https://yourcompany.com/logo.png)
            name: 'AI Byte Consult Ltd.', // Your company or brand name
            welcomeText: 'Hi ðŸ‘‹, how can we help?', // Initial welcome message shown to users
            responseTimeText: 'We typically respond right away' // Message about response time
        },
        style: {
            primaryColor: '#854fff', // Main accent color (e.g., button, header)
            secondaryColor: '#6b3fd4', // Secondary accent color
            position: 'right', // Widget position: 'right' or 'left'
            backgroundColor: '#ffffff', // Background color of the chat interface
            fontColor: '#333333' // Default text color for messages and interface elements
        }
    };
</script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AI-Byte-Consult-Ltd/nics-website-chat-agent@main/Chat%20Widget%20Script"></script>
```

### Customization Guide

You can easily tailor the chat widget to your specific needs by modifying the values within the `window.ChatWidgetConfig` object:

* **`webhook.url`**: **Crucial.** This is where your AI backend (e.g., n8n workflow, custom API) listens for messages. Ensure this URL is correct and secure.
* **`branding.logo`**: Replace `<your company logo URL>` with a direct link to your company's logo image (e.g., `https://example.com/images/my-logo.png`).
* **`branding.name`**: Change `'AIfelix.info'` to your actual company or brand name. This will appear at the top of the chat window.
* **`branding.welcomeText`**: Customize the greeting message users see when they open the chat.
* **`branding.responseTimeText`**: Inform users about your typical response time.
* **`style.primaryColor`**: Set the dominant color of the widget (e.g., for buttons, headers). Use a hex color code (e.g., `#FF0000` for red).
* **`style.secondaryColor`**: Define a complementary color.
* **`style.position`**: Choose `'right'` or `'left'` to decide where the chat bubble appears on the screen.
* **`style.backgroundColor`**: Set the background color of the chat message area.
* **`style.fontColor`**: Choose the text color for messages and other interface elements.
